# Allegro - Product Requirements & Implementation Plan

> *Allegro* (Italian): Cheerful, lively - Bringing joy and energy to music practice

## Product Vision

A personal coaching companion app that listens to kids practicing piano and guitar at home, identifies what they're playing, and provides parents with conversation starters, fun facts, and coaching moments to engage meaningfully with their children's music practice.

**Core Insight:** Turn passive listening into active engagement - help parents who aren't music experts connect with their kids' practice sessions through smart, contextual information.

## Primary Use Case

**The Scenario:** Kids practicing piano/guitar behind your desk at home. You hear them playing but may not recognize the piece or know how to engage meaningfully.

**The Solution:** App running on your phone/computer listens via microphone, identifies the music, and suggests:
- Wise cracks and conversation starters
- Coaching moments and encouragement
- Fun facts about the song/composer
- Similar pieces they might enjoy learning next

## Target Users

**Primary:** Parents of children learning instruments (ages 5-18)
- Want to support their kids' music education
- May not have formal music training themselves
- Looking for ways to engage during practice sessions
- Want to encourage without being overbearing

**Secondary:** Music teachers and tutors
- Can use during lessons to provide context
- Helps explain musical connections and history

## Core Features

### 1. Real-time Music Recognition (Background Listening)
**User Story:** As a parent, I want the app to automatically listen and identify what my kids are playing so I can stay informed without interrupting their practice.

**Requirements:**
- Continuous background listening mode (while app is open)
- Automatic detection when music starts playing
- 5-10 second audio sample capture
- Real-time song identification
- Handle live instrument performances (not just recordings)
- Work with imperfect playing (wrong notes, tempo variations)
- Minimal UI distraction (can run in background)

**Technical Approach:**
- Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for microphone access
- Detect audio activity threshold to trigger recognition
- Capture audio in browser using Web Audio API
- Send audio samples to AudD API for identification
- Display subtle notification when song is identified
- Queue multiple identifications during practice session

### 2. Song Information Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see comprehensive information about the identified song so I can learn about its origins.

**Requirements:**
- Song title and artist
- Songwriter/composer credits
- Album information
- Release date
- Genre/style

**Technical Approach:**
- Primary: AudD API response
- Fallback: MusicBrainz API for additional metadata
- Cache results to reduce API calls

### 3. Songwriter/Composer Fun Facts
**User Story:** As a user, I want to learn interesting facts about the songwriter so I can have engaging conversations about the music.

- [x] Works even with wrong notes (key detection more robust than song ID)
- [x] Confidence scoring and alternate key suggestions
- [x] Chroma visualization (12 pitch classes)
- [x] Meyda.js integration with Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm
- [x] Standalone `/play-along` route

**Implementation Details:**
- `lib/utils/keyDetection.ts` - Krumhansl-Schmuckler key detection algorithm

- [x] Display guitar chord diagrams with fingering (SVG-based)
- [x] Chord history tracking (recent chords played)
- [x] "What chord comes next" prediction based on key + common progressions
- [x] Alternative chord suggestions with confidence %
- [x] Mode tabs on play-along page (Key Mode vs Chord Mode)
- [ ] Test with real practice sessions (manual testing)
- [ ] Handle tempo variations / beat indicator (deferred to 6C)

**Implementation Details:**
- `lib/utils/chordDetection.ts` - Template matching with dot product similarity
- `lib/hooks/useChordDetector.ts` - Real-time hook with chord history
- `components/ChordDiagram.tsx` - SVG guitar diagrams (30+ chords)
- `components/ChordDetector.tsx` - Full UI with predictions
- Updated `app/play-along/page.tsx` - Mode tabs (Key/Chord)

**Phase 6C: Fragment Matching ✅ COMPLETE**
- [x] Song database with 30+ beginner songs and chord progressions
- [x] Fuzzy matching algorithm (tolerates wrong notes, order variations)
- [x] "Sounds like..." UI with confidence scoring
- [x] Song details with chord diagrams and fun facts
- [x] Similar song recommendations
- [x] Connect to coaching content when song identified
- [x] Three-mode UI: Song Mode (default), Chord Mode, Key Mode
